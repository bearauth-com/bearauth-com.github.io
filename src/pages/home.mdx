## How is BearAuth used?

Call the BearAuth API using friendly backend and frontend SDKs.

- Sign up for free at the BearAuth Portal.
- Get an API key.
- Deploy your auth solution in one of the following ways:
  - Add an `/auth` endpoint to your own API using a high-level SDK.
  - Setup a standalone service in AWS or Azure from a pre-made template.
  - Choose complete freedom and call the API any way you like.

## What does BearAuth include?

A RESTful API.

- Multi-tenancy (organizations)
- Identity (users, applications, and services)
- Access (roles, groups, and permissions)
- Passwords (hashing, verification, recovery, strength enforcement, and breach detection)
- Time-based one-time passwords (generation and verification)
- Public key cryptography (key generation, signing, and verification)
- Mocks (testing)
- Managed or self-hosted

(Coming Soon) Backend SDKs for core API access and high-level authorization flows.

## Why is BearAuth different?

With BearAuth, you own your own authentication solution, all for about the same effort and initial cost required to integrate with other SaaS solutions. Owning your own authentication solution provides better security, more control, and lower ongoing cost.

### Better Security

BearAuth uses zero-access encryption to protect your secrets. This means that even if BearAuth is compromised, your secrets are still safe.

Zero-access encryption works by encrypting your secrets with your API keys, which BearAuth never stores. Even BearAuth can't decrypt your secrets unless you make a request with an API key.

Other solutions not only don't use zero-access encryption, but they technically can't do so. They have features like login pages that are end-user facing, so they have to be able to decrypt and use your secrets _independently._ This makes your secrets vulnerable to breaches and misuse.

BearAuth is focused on security, because it's all we do.

### More Control

The user experience is yours. Your website, your components, your design. No redirecting to a 3rd party login page with pay-to-remove 3rd party branding. No page refreshes to re-authenticate. No fiddling with custom domains pointing to a 3rd party. You just need a single `/auth` (or equivalent) endpoint in your own API, and we will even provide the implementation.

The high-level API is always yours, so things like API hooks and visibility into the authentication process are easy. It also means that if you ever want to move away from BearAuth, you can self-host or completely replace the API without affecting the user experience. We'll help you do that too. The vendor lock-in is that low.

### Lower Cost

BearAuth is minimal. The simple and low ongoing cost we pass on to you reflects our focus. We don't need to try to amortize the cost of implementing, maintaining, and supporting a large feature set. Anything we don't do, is a middle markup you avoid.

As you implement your own authentication solution, we can provide consultation engagements for a one-time fee, all the way up to building the whole solution for you on your own infrastructure. Once you have your solution with the features you need, you won't need to pay for more than the ongoing cost of using the API.

The managed BearAuth API subscription fee includes support. But, if you want to self host, flat rate support contracts and one time paid support engagements are available. This can reduce your costs even further, while providing even more security and control.
